# TextData_Mining_ML
Textual data manipulation projects with applications of advanced data mining techniques: recommender systems, information retrieval systems, search engines, latent sentiment analysis, pagerank, PCA.

## Brief description
Most of the machine learning algorithms and pattern recognition (data mining) techniques reported are applied on text-based data:
- a book (*Le Morte D'Arthur* by Thomas Malory)
- a collection of information about songs


The code is organized into notebooks; in each jupyter notebook we focused on a particular class of algorithms and models:
>- `code/MINHASH_LSH.ipynb`: near duplicates analysis and detection throuch the using of a particular hashing (similarity based) techniques;
>- `code/latent_sematic_analyisPCA.ipynb`: latent sematic analysis and identification of topics through dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA);
>- `code/my_search_engine.ipynb`: implementation of a complete search engine and analyze its performances through ad hoc evaluation metrics;
>- `code/pagerank.ipynb`: implementation of the famous Pagerank algorithm and its variations like the Topic_sensitive Pagerank and the Personalized Pagerank;
>- `code/recommendation_sys.ipynb`: implementation of a recommendation system through Collaborative Filtering techniques (item-item matrix approach);
>- `code/supervised_ML.ipynb`: use of several machine learning classifiers in a supervised setup and performance comparison.
